## TODO list
This is a simple experiment working with [Rails Hotwired](https://hotwired.dev)

### How to run

```bash
$ git clone
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create db:migrate
$ bin/dev
```

Tests
```bash
$ rails test
```

Things to improve
```bash
- Use a component library
- Research for Hotwire partials best practices
